1.4.2 (2021-10-28)
==================

### Version 1 ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

We made it!! Version #1!!

Technically it is version 1.4.2. The [42](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42) is a homage to Geek culture.

What makes this release version 1? My view is that version 1 should encapsulate the original vision of the software. The features of the current package is what I imagined when I started drawing up the project. Of course, as I have continued to work on the package I have found many additional enhancements. Also, if it were not for users of the software I would not have had additional feedback which has improved on this package tremendously. I will continue to work on enhancements. There are currently a list of issues I plan to address. I will also address bugs as they are reported. A special thanks goes to all of the contributors. Not only has `tv` been improved by smart contributors, but my own learning experience has been enhanced. Thank you!

* **Feature 1** Added the option to modify the `sigfig` from the command line with the `g` option. [PR #107](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/107). Thanks to @rlewicki for this fantastic contributionðŸŽ‰
* **Bug 1** Added NA alignment. If an NA is in a double or int column then the NA string is right aligned. If it is in a char or any other type it is left aligned. NA stings in double columns do not pass the decimal.[Bug #105](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/105)


0.0.22 (2021-10-18)
==================

Thanks to @Lireer and @rlewicki for the fantastic contributions in this release ðŸŽ‰

* **Feature 1** Color negative numbers [PR #98](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/98)
* **Feature 2** Parse `\t` as tab delimiter [PR #99](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/99)
* **Feature 3** Check file extensions to choose a delimiter [PR #100](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/100)
* **Feature 4** Use atty to omit text coloring and decorations  [PR #95](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/95). 

Along with these new features came additional tests. 

Since [PR #98](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/98) was a aesthetic change it was also added as an additional parameter to be tweaked with a config file.

0.0.21 (2021-10-09)
==================

* **Feature 1** Add configuration via `tv.toml`
* **Feature 2** Decimal alignment. Correct formatting with a single pass. General code clean up. Thanks @jacobmischka!

We also saw @namitaarya fix a help file typo.

0.0.20 (2021-10-02)
==================

* **Feature 1** Detect floats with `f64::from_str`
* **Feature 2** Add the ability to pass file as argument. Not just stdin only.
* [bug #75](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/75):
Cut space from really long doubles.
* [bug #25](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/25):
Exponential notation is not captured as a float. Fixed with above feature 1.

We also saw some code quality improvements in this release. [PR #82](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/82)


0.0.19 (2021-09-29)
==================

The version number jump was due to testing out github actions on automated releases using git tags as the release name. It took a few tries to get right.

* **Feature 1** Add package to snapcraft to increase accessibility.
* [bug #55](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/55):
fix panic on unicode string truncation
* [BUG #40](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/30):
Remove trailing comma.
* [BUG #48](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/48):
Logicals 1/0 were mentioned in comments, but not implemented.
* [BUG #60](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/60):
Ellipsis then space, not space then ellipsis.

The rest of the updates had to do with README updates and spelling errors in code comments.

0.0.13 (2021-09-27)
==================
This version was made possible by the contributions of @Lireer! Thank You!

* [PR #40](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/40) Allow users to specify the deliminator with the `delimiter` option.
* [PR #42](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/42) `clippy` warnings and code refactoring. 
* [PR #41](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/41) change `.len()` to `.chars().count()` to avoid potential column widths if the calue contains code points consisting of multiple bytes.

0.0.12 (2021-09-09)
==================
* [BUG #33](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/33) Elipses used when NA should replace on unquoted string missingness #33
This problem was caused by all of the columns being width 1. When width is 1 the length of the string "NA" is 2. Since 2 was greater
than 1 NA was converted to elipses. To fix this problem I added a min width of 2 and while I was at it I includeed a new option `lower-column-width`
* [BUG #32](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/32) Column with integer 1 and 0 returns NaN for 0.
This bug was caused by logging 0s. I added a condition on the sigfig decision tree to fix.
* **Feature 1** `lower-column-width`: `The lower (minimum) width of columns. Must be 2 or larger. Default 2. `
* **Feature 2** `upper-column-width`: `The upper (maxiumum) width of columns. Default 20.`
* **Feature 2** `debug-mode`: `Print object details to make it easier for the maintainer to find and resolve bugs.` This is to save me time in the futre :smile:

0.0.10 (2021-08-05)
==================
* [BUG #29](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/29) Turns out the column count was correct. `tv` was not printing the last column

0.0.9 (2021-08-05)
==================
Minor Mistakes:

* Added color format to additional footer data.
* [BUG #29](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/29):
Column count was wrong.
* [BUG #28](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/28):
Accidental extra info printed from debug.

0.0.8 (2021-08-05)
==================
Feature Enhancement:

* [BUG #23](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/23):
Simplified the regex for floats.
* [BUG #19](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/19):
Printing "wide" datasets with more columns than space in the terminal resulted in a poor viewer experience. This fix removes extra columns from the print and mentions them in the footer.
